- The log has a new option to indent items, that should help to detect how
  the processing of events/macros/actions work.
- Added a Python shell that you can open through the help menu. A nice
  toy to experiment with Python.
- The setup includes a Windows help file now. You can invoke it through the
  help menu or by pressing F1. The help isn't very complete. It only contains
  some parts from the Wiki till now.

  displayed in red if checked.

  be always on top of all other desktop windows.

0.3.6.1401 (05/16/2008)
=======================
- Added the executables py.exe and pyw.exe to the installer. These are
  Python interpreters, that use the EventGhost library files. You can use
  them to run your own Python code, without the need to install a Python
  distribution or to start EventGhost. The py.exe executable is a
  replacement for the python.exe you would normally find in a Python
  distribution and pyw.exe accordingly for pythonw.exe (that runs code
  without a console, e.g. for scripts that have their own GUI). They
  don't support the command line options of a real Python interpreter,
  but they are anyhow handy for many tasks.


0.3.6.1397 (05/07/2008)
=======================
- The "Show OSD" action now supports multiline text.

  folder by the installer.
- Member eruji added some more actions to the SageTV plugin.

- Added PlayStation 3 Bluetooth Remote plugin from Thierry Couquillou.
- Added volume and seek actions for the foobar2000 plugin.
- Replaced Python's built-in input() and raw_input() with a function that
  shows a simple input dialog. It has no real use-cases in EventGhost, 
  but this way you can experiment with nearly every example code from 
  typical Python tutorials.
- FindWindow now shows a list of the found windows if the test button is 
  pressed.


0.3.6.1248 (12/10/2007)
=======================

- The apply button of all action/plugin configuration dialogs now stays 
  disabled till the user actually has changed a control in the dialog.

  area if the user had changed his display settings while EventGhost is 
  running.


0.3.6.1242 (12/08/2007)
=======================

- The PythonScript action now uses the same configuration panel as all 
  other actions.
- Fix: TechnoTrend USB-IR plugin was not functional after a suspend/resume of 
  the system.


0.3.6.1238 (12/05/2007)
=======================

- The Test Pattern/Geometry action now takes the aspect ratio into 
  account. For ITU-R BT.601 aspect ratios it also shows the "non active" 
  pixels at the sides.
- The Test Pattern/Bars action can now also make double bars.
- Fixed issue, that if you reopened the main window after you have cleared the

- Added a first version of a plugin for Barco CRT projectors.
- All action configuration dialogs now have a "Test" button, that will 
  execute the current settings just like it would if you confirm the 
  dialog and press execute in the toolbar. The difference is, that 
  changes you've made are not stored until you confirm the dialog with 
  the ok button. So you can cancel your changes even if you have pressed 
  the test button.


0.3.6.1190 (11/25/2007)
=======================

- Added DVB Dream plugin from townkat.
- Added Czech language file, MediaMonkey and IrfanView from Pako.
- Added changelog tab in the about dialog.
- Added eg.Exceptions class for generic translatable error messages.
- If a plugin gets into error state, it will now try to restart itself on
  execute, disable/enable or pressing ok or apply in the configuration 
  dialog.
