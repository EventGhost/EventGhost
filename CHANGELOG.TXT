Version 0.3.6.1401 (05/16/2008)
- NEW: Added the executables py.exe and pyw.exe to the installer. These are
       Python interpreters, that use the EventGhost library files. You can use
       them to run your own Python code, without the need to install a Python
       distribution or to start EventGhost. The py.exe executable is a
       replacement for the python.exe you would normally find in a Python
       distribution and pyw.exe accordingly for pythonw.exe (that runs code
       without a console, e.g. for scripts that have their own GUI). They
       don't support the command line options of a real python interpreter,
       but they are neverless handy for many tasks.

       shows a simple input dialog. It has no real use-cases in EventGhost, 
       but this way you can experiment with nearly every example code from 
       typical Python tutorials.
- NEW: FindWindow now shows a list of the found windows if the test button is 
       pressed.

- NEW: All action configuration dialogs now have a "Test" button, that will 
       execute the current settings just like it would if you confirm the 
       dialog and press execute in the toolbar. The difference is, that 
       changes you've made are not stored until you confirm the dialog with 
       the ok button. So you can cancel your changes even if you have pressed 
       the test button.
