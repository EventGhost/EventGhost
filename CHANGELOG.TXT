**0.3.6.1488 (development)**

- Event items now have a configuration dialog, that is somewhat similar to
  the ones of actions and plugins. If you do an "Add Event...", the dialog 
  presets to the last event that was logged.
- The log has a new option to indent items, that should help to detect how
  the processing of events/macros/actions work.
- Added a Python shell that you can open through the help menu. A nice
  toy to experiment with Python.
- The setup includes a Windows help file now. You can invoke it through the
  help menu or by pressing F1. The help isn't very complete. It only contains
  some parts from the Wiki till now.
- After reading `this article on "Joel on Software" 
  <http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/07/01.html>`_, and thinking about 
  it, I decided to follow his advise, except for the "File" and "Edit" menus. 
  So now all other menu items stay enabled and if there's some reason 
  EventGhost can't complete the action, you get a message telling you why.
  

**0.3.6.1487 (12/05/2008)**

- The "log only assigned and activated events" check box is now 
  displayed in red if checked.
- DesktopRemote's "Show" action now has an option to force the window to
  be always on top of all other desktop windows.
- Added a "Start" action to the VLC plugin, that helps to start VLC with the 
  right command line options.
- The list of plugin authors in the about dialog is now automatically
  created from all installed plugins.
- Fixed sticking keys of the Keyboard plugin after some special events (like
  Ctrl+Alt+Delete).
- Many other bugs fixed.


**0.3.6.1459 (09/27/2008)**

- CHeitkamp added basic authentication to the Webserver plugin.
- James Lee provided a new DLL for the MCE Remote plugin, that works
  flawlessly without the replacement driver.


**0.3.6.1446 (06/30/2008)**

- Added Sceneo TVcentral plugin.


**0.3.6.1444 (06/30/2008)**

- Added ATI Remote Wonder II plugin.


**0.3.6.1439 (06/29/2008)**

**0.3.6.1408 (05/22/2008)**

- Added BT8x8 based remote controls plugin from junius.
- Added GOM Player plugin from CHeitkamp.


**0.3.6.1401 (05/16/2008)**

- Added the executables py.exe and pyw.exe to the installer. These are
  Python interpreters, that use the EventGhost library files. You can use
  them to run your own Python code, without the need to install a Python
  distribution or to start EventGhost. The py.exe executable is a
  replacement for the python.exe you would normally find in a Python
  distribution and pyw.exe accordingly for pythonw.exe (that runs code
  without a console, e.g. for scripts that have their own GUI). They
  don't support the command line options of a real Python interpreter,
  but they are anyhow handy for many tasks.


**0.3.6.1397 (05/07/2008)**

- The "Show OSD" action now supports multiline text.


**0.3.6.1394 (05/06/2008)**

- New System.ClipboardChanged event, that fires if an external application
  has changed the clipboard content.


**0.3.6.1387 (04/26/2008)**

- Added Hauppauge IR plugin from Prinz.


**0.3.6.1371 (04/06/2008)**

- Added Spanish translation from karl.
- Added first version of a CyberLink PowerDVD plugin.
- Some Internet shortcuts to the project get added to the startmenu 
  folder by the installer.
- Member eruji added some more actions to the SageTV plugin.
- The ShowOSD action now has a new option "Use Skin". It will draw a 
  skinned background to the OSD. Currently there is only one skin, but I 
  hope more will be added in the future. 


**0.3.6.1285 (03/04/2008)**

- Added Sound Mixer Ex plugin from Dexter.

**0.3.6.1255 (12/13/2007)**

- Added PlayStation 3 Bluetooth Remote plugin from Thierry Couquillou.
- Added volume and seek actions for the foobar2000 plugin.
- Replaced Python's built-in input() and raw_input() with a function that
  shows a simple input dialog. It has no real use-cases in EventGhost, 
  but this way you can experiment with nearly every example code from 
  typical Python tutorials.
- FindWindow now shows a list of the found windows if the test button is 
  pressed.


**0.3.6.1248 (12/10/2007)**

- The apply button of all action/plugin configuration dialogs now stays 
  disabled till the user actually has changed a control in the dialog.
- Fix: Some more plugins had problem with suspend/resume of the computer.
- Fix: It was possible that some dialogs opened outside the visible desktop 
  area if the user had changed his display settings while EventGhost is 
  running.


**0.3.6.1242 (12/08/2007)**

- Now using wxPython 2.8.7.1
- The PythonScript action now uses the same configuration panel as all 
  other actions.
- Fix: TechnoTrend USB-IR plugin was not functional after a suspend/resume of 
  the system.


**0.3.6.1238 (12/05/2007)**

- The Test Pattern/Geometry action now takes the aspect ratio into 
  account. For ITU-R BT.601 aspect ratios it also shows the "non active" 
  pixels at the sides.
- The Test Pattern/Bars action can now also make double bars.
- Fixed issue, that if you reopened the main window after you have cleared the 
  log, the whole log was shown again.


**0.3.6.1223 (12/01/2007)**

- Many enhancements to the ffdshow plugin by Bartman.
- Better handling of colours if the user has changed the colours in his 
  desktop theme.


**0.3.6.1218 (11/28/2007)**

- Added a first version of a plugin for Barco CRT projectors.
- All action configuration dialogs now have a "Test" button, that will 
  execute the current settings just like it would if you confirm the 
  dialog and press execute in the toolbar. The difference is, that 
  changes you've made are not stored until you confirm the dialog with 
  the ok button. So you can cancel your changes even if you have pressed 
  the test button.


**0.3.6.1190 (11/25/2007)**

- Added DVB Dream plugin from townkat.
- Added Czech language file, MediaMonkey and IrfanView from Pako.
- Added changelog tab in the about dialog.
- Added eg.Exceptions class for generic translatable error messages.
- If a plugin gets into error state, it will now try to restart itself on
  execute, disable/enable or pressing ok or apply in the configuration 
  dialog.
