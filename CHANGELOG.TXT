Version 0.3.6.1199 (11/28/2007)
+ First version of a plugin for Barco CRT projectors.
+ All action configuration dialogs now have a "Test" button, that will execute the current settings just like it would if you confirm the dialog and press execute in the toolbar. The difference is, that changes you've made are not stored until you confirm the dialog with the ok button. So you can cancel your changes even if you have pressed the test button.
