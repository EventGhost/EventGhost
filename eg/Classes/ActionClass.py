        Implementation of pre-compiled parameters.

        An ActionClass will only override the "Compile" method, if it uses a 
        special way to implement its action. An action receives a call to 
        Compile every time their parameters change (the user has reconfigured 
        the action) or in the moment the configuration file is loaded and an 
        action of this type is created because it was saved in the tree. 
        The Compile method should return a "callable" object, that will be 
        called without any arguments. This "callable" will then be called 
        instead of the the actions __call__ method.
        This way actions can be build that need considerable time to compute
        something out of the parameters but need less time for the actual 
        execution of the action. One example of such action is the 
        PythonScript action, that compiles the Python source every time it 
        changes and then this compiled code object gets called instead of 
        doing compile&run in the __call__ method.
