        The plugin will also receive its parameters (if it has any) through

        self.TriggerEvent with the event name as *suffix* parameter. It can
        also post optional additional data through the *payload* parameter.

        Keep in mind, that an event generated through this method will also
        automatically be ended immediately. If the plugin wants to generate
        an event with a longer duration, it has to use

        ended immediately. This is used for devices that can have longer
        enduring events, like a remote, where you can press and hold a button.

        The plugin has to call :meth:`!EndLastEvent` to end the event. The last
        event will also be ended, if another event will be generated through
        :meth:`!TriggerEvent` or :meth:`!TriggerEnduringEvent`. This will
        ensure, that only one event per plugin can be active at the same time.
