    Convenience class for wxID's.

    This is an attribute only class. If the attribute name exists in wx as an
    id it will collect that id and set it into this class and return it. If it
    does not exist this class will generate a wxNewId and and set it then
    return it. Every time the same attribute name is used it will always
    return the same id.

    Example:
        widgetId = eg.WXIdManager.OK
            The above will grab the wx.ID_OK and return it.

        widgetId = eg.WXIdManager.SOME_ID
            The above will generate a new wxId and return it.
