class TreePosition:

    Object to find the position of an item inside the tree.

    This class is mainly used by the Undo/Redo handlers to find the
    right position of an item. Because previous Undo/Redo handlers
    might have deleted/restored an item or any of its parents, they can't
    use any direct item reference, but must use an "index path" to find
    the right object.
