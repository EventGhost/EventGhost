    Receiving thread class for the eventghost named pipe.

    When EventGhost gets run a named pipe gets created by the name of 
    "\\.\pipe\eventghost". The pipe is created so that everyone has full 
    control. This allows for an instance of EventGhost to be running as 
    Administrator and be able to send commands into EventGhost as a user.

    EventGhost command line arguments have been changed to use 
    this pipe and has opened up the ability to be able to do things like hide 
    the current running instance from the command line. It has also 
    significantly increased the speed in which the operations are carried out.

    This has been added in a way that will allow for another application that 
    is running on the same computer as EventGhost to be able to make 
    EventGhost perform various tasks. The API is as follows.

    all data written to the pipe has be done as a string. this is a message 
    only pipe and you are not able to send any byte data through it. It is also
    one way communications. the running instance of EventGhost will never 
    write anything to the pipe. the structure of the message is

    function/class/method name, *args or **kwargs

    you are only able to make a call to an existing function/class/method you 
    are not able to set a attributes value directly. you will have to create a 
    function and then you can have data passed to that function via the named 
    pipe and have the function then set the attributes value.

    the args either have to be a list or a tuple empty if there are no 
    parameters to be sent.

    kwargs can either be formatted as 
    dict(keyword1=None, keyword2=None)
    or
    {'keyword1': None, 'keyword2': None}

    any public class/method/function can be accessed by use of this pipe.

    when a command is received it passes the command to the main thread to be 
    evaluated for correctness and to be run. The reason this is done is 2 fold 
    It is so that the named pipe can be created once again as fast as possible 
    without having to wait for the command to finish executing. But also if a 
    command is used that deals with the GUI aspects of EG a lot of the wx 
    components need to be ran from the main thread.
