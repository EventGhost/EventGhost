        """
        This function will call the callable `func` after `waitTime`
        seconds (expressed as a floating point number) with optional 
        parameters, by adding it to the scheduler's queue. A little example:

        .. python::
            def MyTestFunc(myArgument):
                print "MyTestFunc was called with:", repr(myArgument)
            
            eg.scheduler.AddTask(10.0, MyTestFunc, "just some test data")
            
        Ten seconds after invocation of the code it will print the following 
        message to the log::
        
            MyTestFunc was called with: 'just some test data'
        
        The function will also return an object, that you can use as the 
        `task` identifier for `CancelTask()`.

        :Parameters:
          waitTime
            The time to wait in floating point seconds.
          func
            The callable to invoke after the time has elapsed.
          args
            Optional positional arguments for the callable.
          kwargs
            Optional keyword arguments for the callable.

          An object to identify the task.

        This does the same as `AddTask`, but the `startTime` parameter specifies
        an absolute time expressed in floating point seconds since the epoch. 
        Take a look at the documentation of `Python's time module`_, 
        for more information about this time format. Again a little example:
        
        .. python::
            import time
            startTime = time.mktime((2007, 8, 15, 16, 53, 0, 0, 0, -1))
            eg.scheduler.AddTaskAbsolute(startTime, eg.TriggerEvent, "MyEvent")
            
        This will trigger the event "Main.MyEvent" at 16:53:00 on 15 August 
        2007. If you run this code after this point of time, the 
        `eg.TriggerEvent` will be called immediately.
