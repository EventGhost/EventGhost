About EventGhost
================

What is EventGhost? 
-------------------

EventGhost is an open-source automation tool for MS Windows, that can be 
extended through plugins. It can use different input devices like infrared or 
wireless remote controls to trigger macros, that on their part control a 
computer and its attached hardware. After the user has configured everything 
to its needs, the program will run silently in the system tray and waits for 
an event to arrive. So it can be used to control a Media-PC with a normal 
consumer remote for example.

Requirements
------------

EventGhost runs on Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista or above (older OS versions 
are not supported).
