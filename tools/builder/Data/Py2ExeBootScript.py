"""
This script is executed by py2exe for the frozen application directly after
boot_common.py in the py2exe site package has been executed.

The drawback of the default boot_common.py is, that it directs sys.stderr
to a log file (that's fine so far) in the applications program folder (that's
bad for user accounts with limited priviliges).

So we redirect the sys.stderr to a log file in the applications data folder.
