<h3>The Log Monitor action</h3>
<p>The <i>Log Monitor&nbsp;</i>action surveils
the screen log for a given search pattern. When the search pattern
occurs, it fires an event. Optionally the captured log message
can&nbsp;be parsed, e.g. numbers, or other variables might be extracted from the
string.</p><p><b>Important</b>: Make sure when naming the event, and/or global variable, that is <i>different</i>
to the sought after log message; otherwise infinite loops will occur! e.g. if you capture the string&nbsp;<tt>Error</tt>, don't call your event&nbsp;<tt>Error</tt>
as well!</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>The action has two main usages:</p>
<ol><li>A plugin prints useful information to the log,
unfortunately not as events, but as common information messages. You
want to get notified and evaluate this information and perhaps feed another plugin with the information found.</li><li>An unstable plugin crashes quite often. You might want to
capture the error when it occurs, and automatically
restart the EventGhost application. This can be perfectly done with the
<i>EG App Control</i> plugin.</li></ol><ol>
</ol><h4>Parsing log messages / grabbing data</h4>
<p>Once the monitored message has been captured, it can be parsed
for the data you're interested in. The action supports a couple of
different parsing&nbsp;modes. All of them aim to extract variable
data from the log message. A typical example might be: You've got a log
message&nbsp;<tt>HTTP.Volume['80']</tt> and you want to extract <tt>80</tt>, and fire an
event with this data as the payload and set the value of a global variable.</p>
<p>The configuration in this case might look like:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="grab_data.png" height="874" width="533"></p>
<p>Now you can implement an event handler for the event&nbsp;<tt>EGAppControl.VolumeChanged</tt> to get notified when the volume has changed:</p><img alt="" src="grab_data2.png" height="450" width="837"><p>As
configured before, the data is available in&nbsp;<tt>eg.event.payload</tt> as well
as your own defined variable&nbsp;<tt>eg.globals.CurrentVolume</tt>.</p><h5>Regular expressions</h5>
<p>The
parsing mode&nbsp;<i>Apply a regular expression</i> allows to parse the string
with a regex. This mode provides the highest flexibility of parsing the
input data.If you're new to regex syntax, you may find many tutorials
and other ressources about regular expressions in the internet. The
plugin uses Python's <tt>re.findall(searchPattern, logMsg)</tt>
method to parse. Results are always returned as a Python list (which
might be empty, if the search pattern didn't match the log message). </p><h4>Capturing errors</h4>
<p>For capturing errors the following settings might be
appropriate:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="catching_errors.png" height="874" width="533"></p>
<p>In this example the string&nbsp;<tt>Traceback (most recent call last)</tt>
is captured. If you're looking for another error, change the search string
accordingly.</p>
<p>When the error occurs, an event&nbsp;<tt>EGAppCtrl.UnexpectedErrorOccurred</tt> is fired and you can use this event to trigger saving
the configuration and restarting the application.</p>

disabled in this example in order to be able to take a screenshot)</p>
