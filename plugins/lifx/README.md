# eventghost-lifx
Eventghost plugin that connects to your LIFX lights. For now it uses the LIFX HTTP API, but LAN API support could be added.

Add folder LIFX with __init__.py to EventGhost/plugins. Create a [token](https://community.lifx.com/t/creating-a-lifx-http-api-token/25) and provide when the plugin is added.
