Energenie
=========

Energenie is a plug-in for EventGhost (http://eventghost.org/)
It supports Gembird Energenie EG-PM(S)2-LAN power strips.

Due to the limited features of their own software, i decided
to create an Event Ghost plugin that fits my needs.

Installation
============

Download the .zip file from https://github.com/EssKaa/Energenie
Unzip it into the EventGhost plug-in directory.

Usage
=====

This Plugin can be used to control and/or monitor the status of
EG-PM(S)2-LAN switchable power strips.
