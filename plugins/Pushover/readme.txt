Pushover 
========

Pushover is a plug-in for EventGhost (http://eventghost.org/)
Just enter your user and your token and you are good to go.

Configuration
=============

The settings dialogue has some hidden options, resize the window to make them visible.
I could not be bothered to find out how to make a scrollbar.

Installation
============

Download the .zip file from https://github.com/EssKaa/Pushover
Unzip it into the EventGhost plug-in directory.
