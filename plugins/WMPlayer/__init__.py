# changelog:
# 0.2 by bitmonster
#     - changed code to use AddActionsFromList and the new WinApi functions.
# 0.1 by Oystein Hansen
#     - initial version


# Here we define a list of actions we want to produce.
# Every line consists of a tuple with the following items:
#   1. The Python name of the action. (no spaces or special characters, except
#      underscore, must begin with a letter)
#   2. The name of the actions as it is shown to the user.
#   3. A description of the action or None if no descriptions is available.
#   4. Some data that is later assigned to the self.value member of the action.
#      In this case it is an integer value, that is used as the wParam value
#      for the SendMessage function.
