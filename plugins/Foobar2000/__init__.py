# changelog:
# 1.2 by CHeitkamp
#     - changed code to get path from uninstall information
# 1.1 by bitmonster
#     - changed code to use new AddActionsFromList method
# 1.0 by MonsterMagnet
#     - initial version


# Now import some other modules that are needed for the special purpose of
# this plugin.
import os
import _winreg
from win32api import ShellExecute


# This plugin will create its actions dynamically from a list of data.
#
# Here we define a list of tuples, where every tuple contains the following
# information:
#   1. The name of the eg.ActionClass we want to create later.
#   2. A value for the 'name' member.
#   3. A value for the 'description' member.
#   4. A value that is needed by the action to do the actual work. This time
#      it is the parameter that will be used for a command line that calls
#      Foobar2000.
