    Creates a new ``Microphone`` instance, which represents a physical microphone on the computer. Subclass of ``AudioSource``.

    This will throw an ``AttributeError`` if you don't have PyAudio 0.2.9 or later installed.

    If ``device_index`` is unspecified or ``None``, the default microphone is used as the audio source. Otherwise, ``device_index`` should be the index of the device to use for audio input.

    A device index is an integer between 0 and ``pyaudio.get_device_count() - 1`` (assume we have used ``import pyaudio`` beforehand) inclusive. It represents an audio device such as a microphone or speaker. See the `PyAudio documentation <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/>`__ for more details.

    The microphone audio is recorded in chunks of ``chunk_size`` samples, at a rate of ``sample_rate`` samples per second (Hertz).

    Higher ``sample_rate`` values result in better audio quality, but also more bandwidth (and therefore, slower recognition). Additionally, some machines, such as some Raspberry Pi models, can't keep up if this value is too high.

    Higher ``chunk_size`` values help avoid triggering on rapidly changing ambient noise, but also makes detection less sensitive. This value, generally, should be left at its default.
