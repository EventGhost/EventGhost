"""EventGhost Plugin for BT8x8 GPIO based remotes.

Requires DScaler to be installed.

Thanks also to the DScaler project's RegSpy.exe tool, which is the basis of
regspy.dll, making it possible to read the remote in a minimally invasive
fashion (no need for exclusive hardware access), and without requiring 
administrator rights.

Some credit goes also to the BT8x8 plugins produced by the Girder community I
studied many variants to learn the basic pattern of how the remote functions
on most (but not all) BT8x8 cards.

This plugin was developed for the AverTvStudio card. The concepts are
fairly simple and with minor changes it should be possible to adapt the
plugin to many different BT8x8 based devices.

If you want to adapt the plugin to a differnt BT8x8 card, the only essential
details that you need to figure out are the _KEY_MASK and KEYMAP, _DOWN_BIT
(or some other way to different down and up). You can determine your device_id
and vendor_id from regspy.exe.

The function of the "ack bit" is probably specific to the AverTvStudio card,
and it isn't totally necessary to handle the ack bit properly. You could just
strip out all the code related to the ack bit. It isn't essential, given any
reasonable polling rate.

Similarly for the down bit. I could imagine a card where the remote doesn't
give you keyup signals, or doesn't encode it into a single bit, so you may
need to tweak _ReadKey. If you are particularly unlucky, you might have a card
that doesn't provide keyup events, so you would need to modify _BtPoller.

It might be amusing to create a fancy UI that could learn a reasonable
configuration by having the user press all the keys, but given the age of these
cards and the impending doom of analog TV, it might not be worth the trouble.
