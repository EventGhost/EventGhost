NOTICE:

When the plugin first starts up, a SSDP broadcast is sent out to find all Roku players on the
network. The plugin is set to only look for about 1-1.5 seconds. There is nothing that needs
to be done to the code before starting the plugin.

Also, it is probably wise to set your router so that the Roku box gets a static DHCP lease
(same IP address all the time), or to use a host name (if you have a DNS server on your network).
with version 0.2, the action commands store the Roku's SN (part of the USN) instead of a static IP address. The statement
above still holds true for a more reliable experience. But, when ever the plugin restarts it will
automatically look for the Roku players and store the new IP address and the actions will continue
to work. If the IP address changes and the plugin has not restarted, the plugin will catch the exception
when sending an action and search the network one more time and try the action again.  

More info can be found in the comments of the __init__.py file.
