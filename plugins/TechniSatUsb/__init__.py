Plugin for the TechniSat USB IR Receiver

|

.. image:: technisat.jpg
   :align: center

**Note:**
This receiver does not deliver the duration of a key press, so advanced
features like autorepeat are not working with it. It will also only work with
a TS 35 or TTS 35 remote from TechniSat.
