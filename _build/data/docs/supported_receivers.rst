You can read the reason why these devices currently can't be directly supported
in EventGhost `here <http://www.eventghost.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=113>`_.
But you can use them in conjunction with
`WinLIRC <http://winlirc.sourceforge.net/>`_ and the plugin that is `discussed
here <http://www.eventghost.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=219>`_.


If your device is not listed here, feel free to ask on the
`EventGhost Support Forum <http://www.eventghost.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=5>`_
if a plugin can be written for it.
